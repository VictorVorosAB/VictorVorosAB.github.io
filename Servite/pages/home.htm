                Due to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, we regretfully announce that there are currently no Masses, services or group meetings at Our Lady of Dolours Church.
            </p><p>
                <strong>The church will be open for private prayers.</strong>
            </p><p>
                Due to the recent easing of lockdown rules in Europe and the UK, we hope that this situation will change in the near future.
