        <h1>150 Years of Servite Life</h1>
        <p>As part of the 150th Anniversary celebrations in 2014,  Fr Chris O’Brien collated and published a booklet on the history of 150 years of Servite life in London and the English-speaking world.

        <p>The booklet, <strong><em><a href="../documents/Servite Final Booklet 150.pdf">’Celebrating 150 Years of Servite Life’</a></em> </strong> opens with introductions from Fr Colm McGlynn OSM, Prior Provincial and Sr Michelle Reilly OSM. </p>

        <p>There are a few pages containing full-page photos which are appearing as blank pages in the above PDF. However, hard copies of the booklet with the missing photos may still be available from the Parish Office and from Fr Chris for a nominal donation of £2.</p>
