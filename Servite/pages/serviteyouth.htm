        <p>
            Servite Youth is a youth group for those between the ages of 13 and 17. They share the joy and hope of being Catholic teenagers in this 21st century.
            They take part in parish charity work and fundraising. They go on trips together and meet other youth groups.
        </p>
        <p>Servite Youth meet periodically for one hour.</p>
        <p>By coming to Servite Youth you will become more aware of who you are through discussion and sharing your faith. You will learn independence and help spread love.</p>
