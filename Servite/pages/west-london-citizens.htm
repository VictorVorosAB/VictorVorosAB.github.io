        <h1>West London Citizens</h1>
        <p>Our Servite Church is a member of the West London Citizens and by this virtue, all parishioners are members of the West London Citizens group.</p>

        <p>Over the summer in 2011, the group hosted a series of events and meetings to explore community organising on  the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>London Living Wage</li>
            <li>Housing</li>
            <li>Immigration & Green Issues</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            In August this year, the group’s ‘Teach-In’ on ‘Housing’ raised a number of issues. The Housing Benefits Caps introduced as part of the Emergency Budget of
            June 2010 are now beginning to impact some 2341 households living in Private Rented Section in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea.
            Anyone affected, should contact the Housing Group in the parish through the Parish Office.
        </p>

        <p>In September, we gave a talk on our project <a href="http://www.planzheroes.org">PLANZHEROES</a> which aims to stop good food ending up in landfills and find some of this food a good home. Our Lord has provided us, we must not waste.</p>
