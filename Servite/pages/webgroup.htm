        <h1>Servite Web Group</h1>
        <p>The Servite Church website is part of the Our Lady of Dolours Servite Church in London and is for parishioners and visitors.</p>
        <p>This website itself was initiated by Fr Jim Mulherin who had previously served at Our Lady of Dolours Servite Church and is now currently the parish priest of Marley Grange Parish in Dublin. </p>
        <p>The current website was designed and created by the web author and webmaster, Jo Voros with a lot of historical content and background information input from Fr Jim. </p>
        <p>To date, it is maintained by the webmaster and members of the Voros family. <b>However, it relies on contributions from parishioners to keep it up to date. </b></p>
        <h2>Feedback and Contributions</h2>
        <p>We welcome feedback, suggestions and contributions any time. </p>
        <p>Parish groups should utilise the website to publicise any events they may have and to make their presence known.</p>
        <p>Any suggestions or news contributions should be sent the webmaster through the Parish Office.<br />

        <p>Contributions should be in the form of a write-up of the news, and if applicable accompanied by photographs. An MS Word or pdf document would be perfect.</p>
        <p>Any document and accompanying photographs sent in by e-mail for publication will be subject to approval by the parish priest and/or the webmaster. </p>
        <h2>Joining Us</h2>
        <p>Uploading new pages on the website is a quick simple task. </p>
        <p>When this website was first set up, most of the write-up was done by the web author.  It involved hours of researching, collation of information and discussions with Fr Jim, and finally write-up of the web pages.</p>
        <p>If you would like to join the web team, we would  like to hear from you.  You do not necessarily need web or IT skills. </p>
        <p>
            We are looking for people who have the time and dedication to:
            <ul>
                <li>investigate and collate news, and </li>
                <li>write up the news as it would be published on the website.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>This can be time consuming and could be equivalent to writing a 300 -500 word essay fortnightly, plus chasing parishioners for further information and/or  photographs. It may involve liaising with or attending meetings of other parish groups for updates.</p>
