                    <h1>The Parish Team</h1>
                    <p>The Parish Team meets every two weeks for one and a half hours to oversee the general running of the parish, co-ordinate the work of the many parish groups   and ministries and plan and organises parish events.</p>
                    <p>The Team is at the service of the Parish and of the more than thirty parish groups. The Team encourages the involvement of parishioners in these groups, provides formation and training in liturgy and catechetics where necessary and seeks to ensure an atmosphere of welcome and compassion in our parish community.</p>
                    <p>Liturgical preparation, especially for the great feasts of Christmas and Easter and for penitential services is a major responsibility for the Team.</p>
                    <p>Amongst the many events organised by the Parish Team are the Autumn, Advent and Lenten talks, the annual Parish Forum and the CaFE programme.</p>
                    <p>In conjunction with the Parish Finance Committee the Parish Team makes decisions regarding the repair and maintenance of the Church.</p>
