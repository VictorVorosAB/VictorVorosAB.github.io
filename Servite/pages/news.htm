        <h4>20th March 2020: No masses until further notice</h4>
        Further to the offical advice from the UK Government on the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, it is with regret that <strong> as of Friday 20 March</strong>, there will be no further Masses, services and group meetings at Our Lady of Dolours Church.
        <strong>The church will be open for private prayers.</strong>
        <br></br>
        We will be assessing the situation closely, and will re-celebrate Masses and regular services when official advice deems it appropriate for us to do so.
        <h4>6th May 2013: Mass for Migrants at Westminster Cathedral</h4>
        On the 6th of May 2013, The Most Reverend Vincent Nichols celebrated a special Mass
        for Migrants at Westminster Cathedral; an event which was attended by over 2,000
        people. Our very own Servite community was involved in the celebrations
        in various ways. Information about this mass, its history and a transcript of the
        homily can be found <a href="http://rcdow.org.uk/news/mass-for-migrants-2013">here</a>.
        Below are some photos from the day:
