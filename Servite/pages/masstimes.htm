            Further to the offical advice from the UK Government on the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic,
            there will be no further Masses, services and group meetings at Our Lady of Dolours Church <strong>as of Friday 20 March</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                The church will be open for private prayers.
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            We will be assessing the situation closely, and will re-celebrate Masses and regular services when official advice deems it appropriate for us to do so.
