        <h1>Justice and Peace</h1>
        <p>
            The Parish Justice and Peace Group started in March 2005 with the aim of deciding which National or International issues our parish should focus on.
            We do this by study, prayer and action and we aim to help the members of the parish become more aware of such issues and perhaps get involved in taking action.
            We also link up with some <a href=" west-london-citizens.htm">West London Citizens</a> events as they deal with local issues.
        </p>

        <p>Early campaigns of the Justice and Peace Group have included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Migrants&rsquo; Mass in Westminster Cathedral and the rally in Trafalgar Square, in May 2007.</li>
            <li>The Make Poverty History campaign of 2005.</li>
            <li>The peaceful demonstration at the G8 Summit in Edinburgh in July 2005.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Past studies by the Justice and Peace Group have focussed on sex trafficking which included a visit to the exhibition in
            Trafalgar Square and sending a letter to our MP, Sir Malcolm Rifkind.
            During our sharing we felt the need to start Fair trade in our parish. Fair trade is now a thriving regular event at
            our parish raising funds to promote fairer trading conditions for disadvantaged producers and consumers and to help them gain more control over their lives
        </p>

        <p>
            In September 2011, we reflected on treating people from every country in the world with dignity and respect.
            Sadly, today, slavery is rampant; people, especially women and children are being trafficked and exploited across our world.
            People are used, abused, and discarded. The Group is working and praying to change our world and resolve to see the image of God in every human person.
