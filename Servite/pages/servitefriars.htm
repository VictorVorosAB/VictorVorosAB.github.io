            Before the Servites ever existed as an official religious Order, seven prosperous men came together in the city of Florence, Italy. As a reflection of the penitential spirit of
            the times, it had been the custom of these men to meet regularly as members of a religious society established in honor of Mary, the Mother of God. Eventually, the seven left their
            comfortable homes, put aside their finery and went to live together in a ramshackle building. This event is believed to have happened in 1233 which is regarded as the foundation date
            of the order.
        </p>


        <p>
            The holiness and penitential lifestyle of the seven quickly attracted visitors and others who wished to join them in their newly found joy of fraternal living for the sake of
            the Gospel. The entire group moved to more peaceful surroundings, and established a hermitage on the summit of a nearby mountain, Monte Senario, sometimes known as the
            &ldquo;sounding mountain.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            Coming to be known as the &ldquo;Friar Servants of Mary,&rdquo; others joined the first seven on Monte Senario, and as the group continued to grow, the seeds of the new
            religious Order took root. The Friar Servants of Mary were approved as a religious Order by the bishop of Florence sometime between the years 1240 and 1247. In the year 1304,
            the Order of Friar Servants of Mary received definitive approval as a religious Order in the Church by the Holy See.
        </p>

        <p>
            Today Servite Friars are found in Europe, North and South America Africa, Asia, and Australia. From a humble beginning we have been blessed with a long and rich history. We still,
            like our Seven Founders, go where the needs of God&rsquo;s people demand that we go. And we still seek the perfection of the Gospel way of life under the protection of Mary, the
            Mother and Servant of the Lord.
        </p>

        <p>In addition to the Seven Founders, saints of the Order include: St Philip Benizi, St. Juliana Falconieri, St. Peregrine, St. Anthony Pucci, and St. Clelia Barbieri.</p>
